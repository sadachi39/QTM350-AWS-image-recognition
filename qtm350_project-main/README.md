# qtm350_project
This project examines the sensitivity of AWS Rekognition using images of actors in different roles with facial and physical transformations.

# How to open the files:
Upload the notebooks into AWS Sagemaker notebook and run them. The Kernel for the notebooks is python3. The S3 buckets are public so there is no need to add them manually again.

# The notebooks:
The notebooks come with description for each function. The first notebook, project.ipynb, tests AWS Celebrity Rekognition and Facematch for the photos in each bucket. The second notebook, making dataframe.ipynb, creates the mega dataframe with different variables. The last notebook, regression.ipynb, produces graphs with the data from the second notebook.
